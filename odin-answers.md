## **What are functions useful for?**
> functions are useful for storing some pieces of code or actions that are going to be used many times over and then calling that code whenever we need it rather than having to type out the same code multiple times

## **How do you invoke a function?**
> by typing the function's name and append parentheses next to it (e.g alert())

## **What are anonymous functions?**

## **What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?**
> determine whether the program has user interface, what is the input, what is the desired output, what are the steps or algorithms to reach the desired output, write pseudocode based on that algorithms

## **What is an algorithm?**
> algorithm is step-by-step processes that has to be taken to reach a certain goal. In computer programming, algorithm is some steps that has to be taken or executed by a program to solve a problem

## **What is pseudocode?**

## **What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?**
> it makes the problem easier to understand. It makes the problem less intimidating. it makes it easier to find the solution. it saves time and energy, etc

## **What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?**

## **What is the key difference between an error and a warning?**
> when we have errors, the program or program's processes will be terminated and prevent further action, while a warning may not necessarily crashed the program

## **What is one method you can use to resolve an error?**
> try google, use debugger, use console, etc

## **Why is it important to write clean code?**
> because clean code makes the code easy to read for developer(s) to understand, which in turn makes future development and/or debugging much easier and effective

## **Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned**
> avoid making extremely lengthy function, pay attention to indentation, use naming standards for variable and function, make explanatory comments, don't abuse and overuse comment, caution when changing code, etc

## **What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?**
> good comment answers the question why not how, it can also explains algorithms/procedures that is not  completely obvious at the first glance, it can also explains the rationale why the developer using certain methods rather than other alternative methods. Bad comment on the other hand explains how the code works even though the code is already self-explanatory, it can also be irrelevant to the code itself (e.g state the address of the coder or any other personal explanatory notes, etc)

## **What is an array?**
> an array is a variable that can hold value(s)

## **What are arrays useful for?**
> arrays are useful for storing many values with a single name which can be accessed and/or iterated by its index number

## **How do you access an array element?**
> by using its variable name followed by its index number enclosed by square brackets "[]" (e.g names[2])

## **How do you change an array element?**

## **What is the continue statement?**
> continue keyword is used inside a loop to skip current iteration into the next one.

## **What is the advantage of writing automated tests?**
> writing automated tests is more productive than writing code without tests as it saves times for us to check our code's desired output.

## **What is the DOM?**
> DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of a webpage or an HTML document that contain "nodes" with differing relationships depending on how they are arrange in the HTML document

## **How do you target the nodes you want to work with?**
> by using "selectors" like the CSS-selectors (div, .class, #id) or relational selectors (firstElementChild) and then use document.querySelector() function

## **How do you create an element in the DOM?**
> by using document.createElement(tagName) function

## **How do you add an element to the DOM?**
> by using parentNode.appendChild(childNode) function

## **How do you remove an element from the DOM?**
> by using parentNode.removeChild(childNode) function

## **How can you alter an element in the DOM?**
> there are many element's properties that can be altered namely attributes (by using element.setAttribute() function), adding class (by using element.classList.add() function), adding text (by using element.textContent() function), adding HTML (by using element.innerHTML() function)

## **When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML? Why?**
> by adding text, it is strongly recommended to use the textContent function because using innerHTML could pose security risks if not done correctly

## **Where should you include your JavaScript tag in your HTML file when working with DOM nodes?**
> we can include the JavaScript tag in the bottom of the HTML file or preferebly in the <head> section and include the defer keyword to it

## **How do “events” and “listeners” work?**
> events are actions that happens in our webpages like mouse-click or keypresses which we can manipulate with JavaScript to listen to our webpages and react to it. Basically we can make our webpage to react dynamically on certain events by assign an event listener to our webpages (or webpages' elements) 

## **What are three ways to use events in your code?**
> you can specify function attributes directly on your HTML elements, you can set properties of form on[eventType] (onclick, onmousedown, etc.) on the DOM nodes in your JavaScript, or you can attach event listeners to the DOM nodes in your JavaScript. Event listeners are definitely the preferred method

## **Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?**
> because it is more clean, flexible and powerful as it can handle multiple event listener

## **What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?**
> using named functions can clean up your code considerably, and is a really good idea if the function is something that you are going to want to do in multiple places

## **How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?**
> by using document.querySelectorsAll() function to select multiple node (nodelist) and then using nodeList.forEach() function and for each node assign it the event listener

## **What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?**
> element.querySelector(selector) - returns a reference to the first match of selector. element.querySelectorAll(selectors) - returns a “nodelist” containing references to all of the matches of the selectors

## **What does a “nodelist” contain?**
> an array-like object which contain a node of DOM references

## **Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.**
> the bubbling principle happens when an event occurs on an element, it first runs on the handler on it (the element where the event first started), and then on its parent, then all the way up to the other ancestors. In other words, it is a bottom-up approach of the event propagation process. On the other hand, the capture principle is the opposite of the bubbling principle. The capture principle happens when an event occurs on an element, it first runs on the very top ancestors and then move all the way down to the target element when the event occured. In other words, it is a top-down approach of the event propagation process

## **What is the difference between objects and arrays?**
> objects have key:value pair while arrays only has value

## **How do you access object properties?**
> by using he dot notation: obj.property. Alternatively we can use square brackets notation obj["property"]. Square brackets allow taking the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey]

## **What is Array.prototype.map() useful for?**
> Array.prototype.map() is useful for doing something to each of the array value and returning a new array

## **What is Array.prototype.reduce() useful for?**
> Array.prototype.reduce() is useful for doing something to each of the array value by using the returned result from previous iteration and return a new value by the end of the indices
